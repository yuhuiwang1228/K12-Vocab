Dear Mary,

I’m glad to know your mum is coming to China. I hope she can stay
in Beijing for some time. It is in the north of China. She can visit the
Great Wall and the Summer Palace there. Shanghai is also an interesting
big city. It is in the east of China. She can visit the Bund, Yuyuan Garden

Guilin is in the south of China. She can see beautiful rivers and

Elephants are mammals. They can be four metres tall. They don’t
eat meat. They only eat fruit, leaves and grass. They need a lot of food,
so they spend most of their time eating. They only sleep for about four _
hours every night.

The elephant has two long, white teeth called tusks. It is the only
animal with a trunk —a special long nose. The elephant can use its trunk
to pick up a big tree or a small peanut. The elephant is also the mammal
| with the biggest ears. They look like two big fans.

One night, when Daniel was sleeping, he heard a terrible noise.
_ His cat Precious was crying. Daniel was very tired, so he didn’t
get up. Then Daniel’s face felt wet — Precious was licking his face.
Daniel pushed her away. Suddenly, Precious bit Daniel’s ear very
hard. Daniel sat up. The room was very hot and there was a lot of
smoke. His house was on fire! He picked up Precious and ran out
of the house.

Daniel was very happy with Precious. His clever cat saved him!

Colours and Feelings

get very angry. But in China, red is a happy colour. We wear red
‘clothes at Chinese New Year and give money in red envelopes.
| Yellow and orange are cheerful summer colours. Sunshine looks
| Orange, and golden yellow is the colour of a sandy beach.

Blue is the colour of the sky and the sea. In English, you “feel
: blue” when you are sad. Green sometimes means safety. At traffic
| lights around the world, the green light means “go”.
Purple is a colour for wealth and success. In the USA, the
| Purple Heart is a famous medal given to very brave soldiers, so

My hobby is travelling. I am in Sanya now. I can see the beautiful
beach and big blue sea in front of me. I am going to go swimming
this afternoon and then I am going to eat fresh seafood on the beach.
Tomorrow I am going to go boating on the sea. Then I am going to fly
back home.

In the summer vacation, I am going to go to Chengdu by train. I am
going to see pandas and eat lots of delicious Chengdu snacks. I am
going to see many old buildings and take lots of photos. I think it is
going to be a great holiday!

It is the day after Christmas, a day
