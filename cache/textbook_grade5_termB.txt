阅读 方面 ， 希 望 你 能 读 懂 小 短文 或 小 故事 的 大 意 ， 并 比较 流利 地 朗
读 它 ; 在 写 的 方面 ， 希 望 你 能 模仿 范例 或 借助 提示 ， 写 出 几 句 意义
连贯 的 话 。

同时 ， 你 将 继续 学 习 “ 自 然 拼 读 ” 魔 法 。 经 过 四 年 多 的 学 习 ，
你 已 经 能 够 听 懂 、 会 说 很 多 英语 单词 了 ， 但 有 些 单词 不 一 定 会 拼
写 ，“ 自 然 拼 读 ” 魔 法 能 帮 你 拼 出 它们 的 读音 、 更 快 地 记 住 它们 的

最 后 ， 别 忘 了 这 个 小 窍门 : 在 阅读 之 前 ， 先 看 看 短文 或 故事 的
标题 和 插图 ， 大 致 猜测 一 下 它 的 内 容 再 去 阅读 ， 这 能 帮助 你 理解 得 更
快 、 更 好 。 在 阅读 过 程 中 ， 如 果 碰 到 不 认识 的 单词 ， 可 以 根据 插图 和
上 下 文 猜 猜 它 的 意思 ; 或 者 尝试 用 “自然 拼 读 ”魔法 拼 出 它 的 读音 ，
没准 你 就 知道 它 的 意思 了 。 在 读 完 之 后 ， 可 以 回味 、 总 结 一 下 ， 看 看
自己 获得 了 什么 信息 ， 学 到 了 什么 知识 或 得 到 了 什么 启发 。

好 了 ， 现 在 就 让 我 们 继续 “新 起 点 英语 ”之 旅 吧 。

I. Look at the pictures below. Guess what you will read. Then read
the passage.

New Year’s Day is a day for a party. People start the party on December
31st. Then at 12 o’clock they say “hello” to the new year together.

Another special day is Children’s Day. On this day, many people give
presents to children. Children like to play games and have fun. It’s a great
day!

On Teachers’ Day, children say “thank you” to their teachers. They also
help to clean the teachers’ offices.

Dads work very hard for their families. Children can thank their fathers
on Father’s Day. Some children make cards for their fathers.

Mothers are very special, too. Children can show their love to their
mothers on Mother’s Day. They can make breakfast for them, or help them
do chores.

Christmas is a special day in Western countries for all the family. People
give presents to their friends and family. Many people put Christmas trees
in their homes, too.

@ Good to know. 人

There are some interesting old ways to
send messages. Some people use smoke
to show they need help. Their friends can
see the smoke, and they know there is a
problem. Then they will go to help.

Other people use birds to send messages. They take
a bird from its home. They write a small message on
Se some paper and put the paper on the bird’s leg. Then
the bird will fly back home with the message.

Of course, there are many new ways to send
messages today. Many people use the Internet
to send messages. The messages travel around
the world very quickly. People also send text
messages on their phones. It’s very fast, too.

The Animals Who Play Music

One day, a cow leaves his home on a farm.
He can play the horn. He wants to play music
in the town.

On the way to the town, the cow sees a dog
doing the dishes. The cow asks the dog, “Do
you want to play music in the town with
me?” “Sure, I’d love to. But first, I have to
get my drum.” “Hurry!” says the cow. “We
can play music together.”

The cow and the dog walk to the town. On
their way, they see a cat clearing a table.
The cow asks the cat, “Do you want to
play music in the town with us?” “Sure, I'd
love to. But first, I have to get my bells.”
“Hurry!” says the cow. “We can play music
together.”

In the town, they see some robbers going
into a house. “What should we do?” they
ask. The dog says, “I exercise every day, so
I am strong. I should catch the robbers.” The
cat says, “I drink milk every day, so I am
strong. I should catch the robbers.”

42
The cow says, “I have an idea! We should
frighten the robbers away. We are going to
give a concert. I am going to play my horn.
Dog, you are going to play your drum. Cat,
you are going to play your bells.”

The three friends start to play music. They
get louder and louder. Everyone in the town
comes to the concert. The robbers hear the
music and the people. They’re frightened.
They quickly run away from the town.

The cow, the dog and the cat now have a
new home in the town. Every day, people in
the town can hear them playing the horn, the
drum and the bells.

@ Answer the questions.

1. Who leaves the farm?

2. Who plays the drum?

3. Why is the dog strong?

4, Why is the cat strong?

5. What do the three friends do in the town every day?

the elephant.”

A human baby does not walk until he or she is around
one year old. But many animals learn to get around much
faster.

A baby elephant can stand as soon as it is
born. It can walk, too, but very slowly.

A new baby deer can stand up. Deer must
run fast to be safe. Baby deer can run soon
after they are born.

Baby birds can’t fly when they are born. They spend
their first few weeks in the nest. Then they learn to fly.
Soon they can find their own food.

The Ugly Duckling

Once there was a mother duck.
She was sitting on seven little
eggs. One day, the eggs started
to open. One by one, six little
yellow ducklings came out of
the eggs.

There was still one egg left.
The mother duck sat on that egg {{
again. Two days later, out came
a duckling. But this duckling
wasn’t yellow. It was grey, and
it had a long, thin neck.

The other ducklings didn’t like
the grey duckling. They didn’t
want to play with him. They
said he was ugly. The little
ugly duckling was sad.

Summer came. The ducklings
all grew bigger, and the ugly
duckling was the biggest. One
day they went to a farm. A
chicken bit him, and the farmer
kicked him. The ugly duckling
felt terrible.

The ugly duckling ran away.
He went to the tall grass by the
lake to live by himself. He felt
lonely every day.

Autumn came. The ugly
duckling got bigger and bigger.
He swam by himself every day,
so he got stronger, too.

Finally, spring came. One day,
a little girl came to the lake
with her mother. “Look at the
swan,” she said, “It’s beautiful!” |
The ugly duckling looked at
himself in the water. He wasn’t
a duckling. He was a swan, a
white swan with a long neck. He
wasn’t ugly. He was beautiful!

Our Wonderful Vacations

My name is Jane. Ann is my cousin. We both like travelling, but I like
the sea and she likes old towns. Last summer vacation, I went to Sanya in
Hainan province with my mother. We went there by plane. I played on the
beach and picked up some seashells. I swam in the sea and drank some
juice. I also ate some seafood. I had a wonderful trip.

Ann went to Lijiang in Yunnan province with her mother. They went
there by train. She took some beautiful photos and ate some delicious food
there. She bought a bag of souvenirs. She enjoyed her trip very much. We
both had good vacations.

In high school, Terry Fox was
a popular and hardworking
student. He loved sports. He
played on the school basket-
ball team.

On April 12th, 1980, Terry
started a special trip across
Canada. Every day he ran
about 42 kilometres. He ran
on rainy days, windy days
and hot sunny days. He ran

through small villages and big

cities. Terry ran for 143 days.
It wasn’t easy, but Terry kept
running.

A Special Trip

When he was 18, Terry got cancer. The
doctors had to take off his leg. Terry
never gave up. He learned to walk and run
with his new “leg”. Terry saw so many
people sick with cancer in the hospital. He
wanted to run across Canada to get money
for cancer research.

On September Ist, 1980, Terry felt very
sick. His doctors said that he had to stop
his trip. Terry was very sad. He wanted to
keep running. The people of Canada were
very sad, too. They gave more and more
money for cancer research. They hoped
Terry would get better and would start to
run again. Sadly, Terry died on June 28th,
1981. He was 22 years old.

The people of Canada were very proud of Terry.
They gave him Canada’s highest award. He was the
youngest person ever to win this award. In 1999,
Canadians named him Canada’s greatest hero. Now
in Canada, you can see Terry’s statue everywhere.

Canadians did not forget Terry. Every
September, in many towns and cities

in Canada, there is the Terry Fox Run.
Hundreds of thousands of Canadians,
young and old, run for Terry. They give
money to find a cure for cancer. Since
1981, they have given 300 million dollars.
