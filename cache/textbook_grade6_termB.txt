There are many beautiful buildings in downtown Toronto. Yonge
Street is the longest street in Canada. There are a lot of shops on
this street. My favourite bookshop is there. Next to the bookshop
is a cinema, and there is a bank next to the cinema. Across from
the cinema there is a library. There is a big lake in Toronto called
Lake Ontario. You can see the sports stadium near the lake. The CN
Tower is near the stadium. There is a famous restaurant next to the
stadium. If you get lost, you can go to the police station. It’s near
the park, next to the subway station.

My new school in Canada is very interesting. We study English and
maths every day. In China I studied Chinese every day, but here we only
study Chinese on Monday and Wednesday. I help Ted, because he thinks
Chinese is very difficult!

My favourite class is PE. We have PE class on Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons. I’m learning ice-skating in PE class. It’s hard but fun. I also
like my art class. I study art on Wednesday and Thursday. This week I
made a picture using maple leaves.

I only get homework on Friday! That is very different from China. But
I have to study English every night.

playing football. He is quite helpful and told me many interesting things

Bill, what do you do on weekends in China?

On Saturday mornings, I always go to my maths club. On Saturday
afternoons, I often stay at home and do my homework. Sometimes I
go shopping or go to the cinema with my mum.

What about Sunday?

On Sunday mornings, I always do my homework and then watch TV
or play computer games. Sometimes I help my mum do the dishes.
On Sunday afternoons, I always play sports. I often play ping-pong
or basketball. Sometimes I go swimming. I never do homework on
Sunday nights.

Wow, you’re so busy on weekends!

Yes, I never have enough time! What do you do on weekends?

I don’t have much homework to do on weekends, but I often do some

Ted: I don’t think hamburgers, sandwiches and ice-cream are
healthy. We shouldn’t eat them every day.

Sara: I agree. We should eat more fruit and vegetables, and less
meat and candy. To be healthy, we should also keep clean:
wash our hands before eating and brush our teeth twice a day.

Tony: We should also exercise often. We should exercise at least
one hour a day. Sports are good for us.

I had a wonderful weekend. On Friday evening, Ted showed me his
stamps. He has stamps from all over the world. I’m going to ask my mother
to send him some Chinese stamps.

On Saturday morning, we did chores. I cleaned the living room. Ted took
out the rubbish and watered the plants. Tina cleaned her room. After that,
Ted, Tina and I went to the City Gallery. We saw Uncle Bob’s paintings
there. They were very beautiful. In the afternoon, I read some books.

On Sunday I visited Ted’s grandparents with Ted’s family. In the evening
I watched a nature show about Canadian animals — beavers, raccoons and

like to play sports with my friends. We have Mid-Autumn
Festival in this season. We can eat delicious mooncakes
then. The autumn in Beijing is quite short.

Winter is long and cold. I like to make snowmen with

How do animals spend winter safely? Different
animals have different ways.

Some animals collect their winter food in the
autumn. In the winter, they just stay at home and eat
the food they collect in the autumn. For example,
squirrels collect seeds and nuts, and beavers collect
sticks.

Many birds cannot find food in the winter, so they
fly from the north to the south in the autumn. They
fly back the next spring. For example, swans and
wild geese fly away in the autumn, because they can
find food in the warm south.

Some animals sleep for a long time in the winter.
They eat a lot of food in the autumn. In the winter,
they do not eat anything. They are hungry when they
wake up in the spring. They usually look for food
