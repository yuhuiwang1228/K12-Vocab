亲爱 的 同学 :

你 好 ! 欢迎 回 到 “新 起 点 英语 ”的 世界 。

在 这 里 ， 你 将 继续 通过 听 、 说 、 玩 、 演 、 唱 等 形式 享受 英语 世
界 的 乐趣 ; 同时 ， 你 将 开始 正式 享受 读 、 写 英文 的 乐趣 。 作 为 三 年
级 学 生 ， 在 阅读 方面 ， 你 只 要 能 借助 图 片 读 懂 小 短文 或 小 故事 就 可
以 了 ; 在 写 的 方面 ， 你 只 要 能 根据 语 境 选 择 合适 的 词 填空 ， 把 句子
补充 完整 就 可 以 了 。

从 现在 开始 ， 我 将 教 你 学 习 “ 自 然 拼 读 ” 魔 法 。 经 过 两 年 的 学 习 ，
你 已 经 能 够 听 懂 、 会 说 很 多 英语 单词 了 ， 但 不 一 定 能 认 读 和 拼写 这
些 单词 。“ 自 然 拼 读 ”魔法 能 帮 你 宝 沁 它们 的 读音 、 更 快 地 记 住 它
们 的 写法 。 同 时 ,自然 拼 读 " 魔 法 地 能 避 你 更 快 地 记 住 全 新 的 单词 。
你 储备 的 单词 越 多 ， 读 、 写 英文 的 乐趣 就 越 多 。 所 以 ， 好 好 学 习 这
个 魔法 吧 。

最 后 ， 告 诉 你 一 个 小 窍门 : 在 阅读 小 文 段 或 小 故事 之 前 ， 先 看
看 它 的 标题 和 插图 ， 大 致 猜测 一 下 它 的 内 容 再 去 阅读 ， 这 能 帮 你 理
解 得 更 快 、 更 好 。 在 阅读 过 程 中 ， 如 果 碰 到 不 认识 的 单词 ， 可 以 根
据 插 图 和 上 下 文 猜 猜 它 的 意思 ; 或 者 用 “自然 拼 读 ” 魔 法 拼 出 它 的
读音 ， 没 准 你 就 知道 它 的 意思 了 。

好 了 ， 现 在 就 让 我 们 继续 “新 起 点 英语 ”之 旅 吧 。
