Charlie Chaplin

Charlie Chaplin was a very famous actor. He is still popular
today.

Chaplin was famous for being “the Tramp”,
a strange man with a little hat and very big shoes.
He walked like a duck. He liked playing tricks on bad
people, but he always helped poor
people.

In 1954, when he was invited
to eat Beijing duck, Chaplin
didn’t want to eat it at first. He
said he walked like a duck, so
ducks were his friends. But
Beijing duck was so delicious
that he ate a lot!
